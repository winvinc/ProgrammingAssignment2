## Compution Inverse of Metrix is a costly computation and Time Consumption 
## This Function will use benefic of cachce to reduce computation repeatly 
## by caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. 
## There are two functions that used to cache the inverse of a matrix.

        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
